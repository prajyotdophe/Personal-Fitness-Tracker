# Personal Fitness Tracker

## Overview

The **Personal Fitness Tracker** is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to predict the number of kilocalories burned based on personal input parameters such as age, BMI, duration of exercise, heart rate, body temperature, and gender. The app utilizes machine learning models, specifically Random Forest Regressor, to provide accurate calorie burn predictions based on user data.

## Features

- **User Input Panel:** Users can enter their age, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, and gender.
- **Calorie Prediction:** A trained Random Forest Regressor predicts the calories burned based on user input.
- **Comparison with Others:** The app provides statistical comparisons with other users based on the dataset.
- **Similar Results:** It fetches records from the dataset that have similar calorie burn estimates.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Uses progress bars and tables for better user experience.
